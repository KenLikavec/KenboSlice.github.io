                    My name is Kenneth David Likavec. I was born on February 17th 1989.
                    I worked in the Radiology Field for a little but knew it was something
                    I did not want to do for the rest of my life.  I wanted to have a
                    career in a field i was passionate about and would love to do each
                    and every day. I love being creative and would draw all the time as
                    a child growing up. That is what led me to the computer development field
                    I love the fact that I get to use my creative thinking in putting together
                    and developing a website, I think that it is so rewarding! I chose to go
                    to school at We Can Code It in their part time bootcamp, the skills i learned 
                    there include C#, Html, CSS, Java Script, Jquery and Bootstrap amoung others.
